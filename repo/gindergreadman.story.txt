Ginger Bread man.

Once upon a time, there was a old man and a old woman.
And they didn't have a child.
So one day the old woman said: let's make a ginger bread man.

So they make the dough,
and then they shaped it,
and they did some decoration
and they put it in the oven.

Then the delicious smell was coming.
So they opened the oven, and popped the ginger bread man.

So the old man reached to grab him
but quick as a wink the ginger bread man ran.

And the ginger bread man went out the door
and he reached the old muddy sow.
and the ginger bread man put his little hands on his hips.
And said "run run catch me if you can, you can cant' me, I am the ginger bread man."
So the muddy old sow reached to grab him.
But quick as wink the ginger bread man ran.
