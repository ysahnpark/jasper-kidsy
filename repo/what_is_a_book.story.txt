What Is A Book?

A book is pages, pictures and words
Some have flying witches and birds
A book is like your friend,
But according to me a book never comes to an END!!!

My mom says I read a lot
And that is very good
We have to write about the book we've read
Especially while the story is still in our head

I said that I got full marks
Mum said, "Hey, you're one bright spark!"
I came out first
I was so happy I thought I would burst

My classmates said WOW !
You came out first in the grade
My teacher was so proud of me
She announced me in assembly!!!

You can never go wrong with a book
Because a book is like your friend
And a book as you know never comes to an END!!
